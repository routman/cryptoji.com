Encrypted Emoji

Cryptoji uses AES-256 to encrypt messages into emoji, known as cryptoji. Only those who possess the secret key can decrypt the cyrptoji.

The secret key is optional, though highly encouraged. If you leave the secret key blank, your message can be read by anyone who has a copy of the cryptoji. The more complex the secret key, the stronger the encryption.

All encryption and decryption takes place on your device, and the information you enter into this website is never sent or stored anywhere. The webpage continues to function even after you disconnect your device from your network or turn on airplane mode.

Cryptoji is open source and offered as a free service. Your cryptocurrency donations are always appreciated.
